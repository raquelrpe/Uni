                <h2>Intro</h2>
                    <p>
                        Accessible design and inclusive design are two essential concepts in creating products that cater to a diverse range of users. While they share similarities, they have distinct differences that impact how products are developed to be user-friendly for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or circumstances.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="theory-part">
                <h2 id="accessible">Accessible Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        Accessibility in design focuses on ensuring that interfaces, products, and technologies are usable by people with disabilities. It aims to meet the needs of people with disabilities by following <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank" title="Read more information about Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)"> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> and standards. It is more focused on the end product and ensuring usability for individuals with disabilities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="theory-part">
                <h2 id="inclusive">Inclusive Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        Inclusive design is a broader spectrum that considers user diversity, situational handicaps, and various perspectives to create products for everyone. It is a methodology that challenges designers to make products easier to use for all individuals, not just those with disabilities, by considering permanent, temporary, and situational disabilities alike. Inclusive design relies on testing and creativity to enhance user-friendliness for everyone, without specific legal standards.</p>

                <h2 id="work-together">How They Work Together</h2>
                    <p>Although different in theory, accessible and inclusive design complement each other in numerous ways:</p>

                    <div class="work-together-container">
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>
                                Accessible design is a crucial component of inclusive design, ensuring that products are usable by individuals with disabilities while also benefiting others.</li>
                            <li>
                                Both approaches aim to enhance usability for all users, aligning with the shared objective of making products more practical.</li>
                            <li>
                                By considering design principles from both during the development stage, businesses can increase their customer base and create more user-friendly products.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="work-together-image">
                            <img alt="" src="images/comparison.svg">

                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, while accessible design focuses on meeting the needs of individuals with disabilities through specific guidelines and standards, inclusive design takes a broader approach by considering diverse user perspectives, testing and creating products that cater to a wide range of abilities and situations. Both concepts are essential in creating user-friendly digital products that are accessible to all.</p>
